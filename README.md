Bitcoin Cash is a peer-to-peer version of electronic money allowing payments to be sent directly from one party to another instantly and almost for free without going through a financial institution.

### How to run the site locally

In order to build and run the site you need Ruby üíé and Docker üê≥. Then run:

```shell
gem install bundler
bundle install

# run the development server with:
make serve

# or test the Docker container with:
make run
```

Open a browser to `localhost:4000` or `localhost:8080` respectively.

You can then submit pull requests to this repository.
