Agenda
======
We are a software company that specializes in quantitative supply chain optimization. We see a great potential for BCH to improve supply chains from many angles. However, all those use cases rely on the availability of a highly scalable blockchain due to the amount of data involved. Thus, with a sponsorship from CoinGeek and nChain, we have started Terab, an open source initiative intended to deliver an optimized key-value store dedicated to the management of the UTXO set. Terab is designed as a micro-service.
