# Document Purpose

This document is intended to provide a single source of truth of the status of ongoing op codes
discussions relative to the upcoming hardfork. Any discussions not related to the latest upcoming
fork will be referenced and postponed until the next hardfork or removed entirely if the discussion
is in a complete form and no spec is planned to be proposed. Implementation details or specs of
particular op codes is out of scope of this document, however they will be referenced.
