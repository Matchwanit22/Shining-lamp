# Discussion Topic

Collaboration of work to produce a protocol specification document of Bitcoin Cash.

# Brief overview of discussion

 * Existing and possible unit test suites
 * Possible use of the lib consensus project, either as an extension or contribution
 * Expressions of interest from various parties to and how to engage/reach said parties.
    * Workgroup of developers in Tokyo in March 2018 with representation from each of the relevant development groups (1-2 days)
    * Date proposed is 21 and/or 22nd March 2018
    * Organisation of room booking logistics and availability of participants to be discussed in near future. Including if we should do 1 or 2 days.
 * Discussion on where to begin the documentation
    * Proposed to start at the consensus layer/script engine to leverage the current focus on OP_CODES
        * Discussion of the high level process of designing a spec document
        * Tackle the individual OP_CODES one by one
        * The P2P layer to be determined if it is part of the protocol
 * Discuss the scope of the proposed development workgroup
    * Minimum goal is to get a specification of the consensus layer, followed by policy and P2P
    * Discussion on how in-depth the workgroup is intended to be
        * Is there anything we need to have people bring with them
        * Possible start before the workgroup with a few OP_CODES to produce a baseline example
 * Document should be well explained and unambiguous
 * Bitcoin Wiki Protocol spec page (and other existing papers) could provide a starting source.
    * These also need review to ensure they are accurate
